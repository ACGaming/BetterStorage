BetterStorage
=============

.. is a [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net/) mod which adds more storage options. It aims
for fun, interesting and balanced features which would fit well into vanilla Minecraft,
but also work nicely together with other mods. Information about most of the blocks and
items BetterStorage adds can be found in its [thread on the Minecraft Forums]
(http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1548203-/).

If you want to contribute, be sure to talk to me first.  
You can reach me on the forums, via [email](mailto:halfnerd.copygirl@gmail.com) or on
[#obsidian on EsperNet](irc://irc.esper.net/#obsidian).

If you want to work with or compile BetterStorage yourself, you will need to grab the
API of [Thaumcraft](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1585216-/), as it's not included
in this repository.

Localizations
-------------

If you want to contribute localizations, make sure to keep the indentations intact. Use
tabs, not spaces. The ```#```'s in the tooltip section are used as new lines. Keep the
tooltips short, try to use the same amount of ```#```'s as the en_US language file or
less.

You can test your translation by moving it to ```assets/betterstorage/lang/``` in the
mod's .zip file. Use this to make sure the tooltips look good with different window
sizes and GUI scales.
