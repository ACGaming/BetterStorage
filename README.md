BetterStorage
=============

.. is a [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net/) mod which adds more storage options. It aims
for fun, interesting and balanced features which would fit well into vanilla Minecraft,
but also work nicely together with other mods. Information about most of the blocks and
items BetterStorage adds can be found in its [thread on the Minecraft Forums]
(http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1548203-/).

If you want to work with or compile BetterStorage yourself, you will need to grab the
APIs of [Thaumcraft](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1585216-/) and
[Inventory Tweaks](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1720872-/), as they're not
included in this repository.
