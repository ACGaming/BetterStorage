<page type="text">Enchanting a backpack with some fabric and a thaumium ingot will make it able to store more items. It will also make sure items inside with the repair enchantment can still repair themselves as if they were in your inventory.
Due to its magic nature, it will generate small amounts of flux if it's too full.
Since it is linked to the aura, it probably isn't a good idea to wear this while the flux in the environment is high.</page>
